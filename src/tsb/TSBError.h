   *
   * When a libTSB operation on TSB content results in a warning, error
   * or other diagnostic, the issue is reported as an TSBError object.
   * TSBError objects have identification numbers to indicate the nature
   * of the exception.  @if clike These numbers are drawn from
   * the enumeration <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorCode_t">
   * TSBErrorCode_t</a>.  @endif@if java These numbers are
   * defined as unsigned integer constants in the file
   * "libtsbConstants.html".  See the <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorCode_t">top of this documentation page</a> for a table
   * listing the possible values and their meanings. @endif@if python These
   * numbers are defined as unsigned integer constants in the interface
   * class @link libtsb libtsb@endlink.  See the <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorCode_t">top of this documentation page</a> for a table
   * listing the possible values and their meanings. @endif@~ The argument
   * @p errorId to this constructor @em can be (but does not have to be) a
   * value from this @if clike enumeration. If it @em is a value
   * from <a class="el" href="#TSBErrorCode_t">TSBErrorCode_t</a>, the
   * TSBError class assumes the error is a low-level system or TSB layer
   * error and <em>prepends</em> a built-in, predefined error message to
   * any string passed in the argument @p details to this constructor.  In
   * addition, all <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorCode_t">TSBErrorCode_t</a> errors have associated
   * values for the @p severity and @p category codes, and these fields are
   * filled-in as well from the enumerations <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorSeverity_t">TSBErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorCategory_t">TSBErrorCategory_t</a>,
   * respectively. @else set of constants.  If it @em
   * is one of the predefined error identifiers, the TSBError class
   * assumes the error is a low-level system or TSB layer error and
   * <em>prepends</em> a built-in, predefined error message to any string
   * passed in the argument @p details to this constructor.  In addition,
   * all the predefined error identifiers have associated values for the
   * @p severity and @p category codes, and these fields are filled-in using
   * the libTSB defaults for each different error identifier. @endif@~
   *
   * If the error identifier @p errorId is a number greater than 99999, the
   * TSBError class assumes the error was generated from another part of
   * the software and does not do additional filling in of values beyond
   * the default in the constructor itself.  This allows TSBError to serve
   * as a base class for other errors, such as for user-defined validation
   * rules (see Validator).  Callers should fill in all the parameters with
   * suitable values if generating errors with codes greater than 99999 to
   * make maximum use of the TSBError facilities.
   *
   * @if clike As mentioned above, there are two other
   * enumerations, <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorSeverity_t">TSBErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorCategory_t">TSBErrorCategory_t</a>, used for indicating
   * the severity and category of error for the predefined TSBError codes.
   * The values passed in @p severity and @p category override the defaults
   * assigned based on the error code.  If the value of @p errorId is a
   * value from <a class="el" href="#TSBErrorCode_t">TSBErrorCode_t</a>,
   * callers do not need to fill in @p severity and @p category.
   * Conversely, if @p errorId is not a value from <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorCode_t">TSBErrorCode_t</a>, callers can use other
   * values (not just those from <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorSeverity_t">TSBErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorCategory_t">TSBErrorCategory_t</a>, but their own
   * special values) for @p severity and
   * @p category. @else As mentioned above,
   * there are additional constants defined for <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorSeverity_t">standard severity</a> and <a class="el"
   * href="#TSBErrorCategory_t">standard category</a> codes, and every predefined
   * error in libTSB has an associated value for severity and category taken
   * from these predefined sets.  These constants have symbol names
   * prefixed with <code>LIBTSB_SEV_</code> and <code>LIBTSB_CAT_</code>,
   * respectively.  If the value of @p errorId is one of the standard error
   * codes, callers do not need to fill in @p severity and @p category in a
   * call to this constructor.  Conversely, if @p errorId is not an existing
   * TSB-level error code, callers can use other values for @p severity and
   * @p category. @endif@~
